# Vending Machine

Vending machine controller designed in VHDL
This was also done for a course project I enjoyed a little too much...

The goal was to design a vending machine controller with the following instruction set and specs:

We went the extra mile and added inventory tracking.

# ALU VHDL
An ALU designed in VHDL


This was done for a course asssignment I enjoyed a little too much...
The goal was to design an 8-bit ALU with the following instruction set and specs:

</p>

Though it wasn't specified how to do that, I decided to take the longer route and define some componentes from scratch and make them generic so they expand beyond 8-bits.
